[main]
# Objects and their properties are defined here, such as the SecurityManager, Realms, etc.
# You may configure JDBC realm as follows:
ds = com.mysql.jdbc.jdbc2.optional.MysqlDataSource
ds.serverName = localhost
ds.user = admin
ds.password = password
ds.databaseName = auth

jdbcRealm = org.apache.shiro.realm.jdbc.JdbcRealm
jdbcRealm.dataSource = $ds
jdbcRealm.permissionsLookupEnabled = true
jdbcRealm.authenticationQuery = SELECT password FROM users WHERE username = ?

[users]
# The 'users' section is for simple deployments when you only need a small number of statically-defined
# set of user accounts.

[roles]
# The 'roles' section is for simple deployments when you only need a small number of statically-defined roles.

[urls]
# The 'urls' section is used for url-based security in web applications. We'll discuss this section in the
# web documentation.
