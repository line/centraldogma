Configuration
=============
The main configuration file is located at ``conf/dogma.json``, with most properties set to their sensible
defaults:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "dataDir": "./data",
      "ports": [
        {
          "localAddress": {
            "host": "*",
            "port": 36462
          },
          "protocol": "http"
        }
      ],
      "numWorkers": null,
      "maxNumConnections": null,
      "requestTimeoutMillis": null,
      "idleTimeoutMillis": null,
      "maxFrameLength": null,
      "numRepositoryWorkers": 16,
      "cacheSpec": "maximumWeight=134217728,expireAfterAccess=5m",
      "webAppEnabled": true,
      "gracefulShutdownTimeout": {
        "quietPeriodMillis": 1000,
        "timeoutMillis": 10000
      },
      "replication": {
        "method": "NONE"
      },
      "securityEnabled": false,
      "mirroringEnabled": true,

    }

Core properties
---------------
- ``dataDir`` (string)

  - the path to the data directory which contains the repositories served by Central Dogma and
    other stateful data. Can be a relative path from the root directory of the distribution.

- ``ports``

  - the server ports that serve the incoming requests.
  - ``localAddress`` - the bind address of server socket.

    - ``host`` (string)

      - the IP address or ``*`` to bind to all network interfaces.

    - ``port`` (integer)

      - the port number. 36462 is preferred.

  - ``protocol`` (string)

    - the protocol. ``http`` is the only supported protocol at the moment.

- ``numWorkers`` (integer)

  - the number of I/O worker threads. If ``null``, the default value of ``<numCpuCores> * 2``
    is used.

- ``maxNumConnections`` (integer)

  - the maximum number of TCP/IP connections that can be handled concurrently.
    Any connection attempts that make the number of connections exceed this value will be rejected immediately.
    If ``null``, no limit is enforced.

- ``requestTimeoutMillis`` (integer)

  - the maximum number of milliseconds allowed for handling a request.
    If a request takes more than this, the server may respond with a ``503 Service Unavailable`` response.
    If ``null``, the default value of '10000 milliseconds' (10 seconds) is used.

- ``idleTimeoutMillis`` (integer)

  - the number of milliseconds before closing an idle connection.
    The server will close the connection if it stays idle for more than this without any pending requests.
    If ``null``, the default value of '15000 milliseconds' (15 seconds) is used.

- ``maxFrameLength`` (integer)

  - the maximum length of request content. If a client sends a request whose content
    is longer than this, the server may respond with a ``413 Request Entity Too Large`` response.
    If ``null``, the default value of '10485760 bytes' (10 MiB) is used.

- ``numRepositoryWorkers`` (integer)

  - the number of worker threads dedicated to handling repository reads and writes.
    If ``null``, the default value of '16 threads' is used.

- ``cacheSpec`` (string)

  - the cache specification string which determines the capacity and behavior of the repository
    access cache. Refer to `the Caffeine API documentation
    <https://static.javadoc.io/com.github.ben-manes.caffeine/caffeine/2.5.5/index.html?com/github/benmanes/caffeine/cache/CaffeineSpec.html>`_
    for more information. Note that the weight of the cache has been tuned to be roughly proportional to its
    memory usage.

- ``webAppEnabled`` (boolean)

  - whether to enable the web-based administrative console. Enabled by default.

- ``gracefulShutdownTimeout``

  - the amount of time to wait after the initiation of shutdown procedure for requests to go away before
    the actual shutdown of the server.
  - ``quietPeriodMillis`` (integer)

    - the number of milliseconds to wait for active requests to go end before shutting down.
      0 means the server will stop right away without waiting.

  - ``timeoutMillis`` (integer)

    - the number of milliseconds to wait before shutting down the server regardless of active requests.
      This should be set to a time greater than ``quietPeriodMillis`` to ensure the server shuts down
      even if there is a stuck request.

- ``replication``

  - the replication configuration.
  - ``method`` (string)

    - the replication method. ``NONE`` indicates 'standalone mode' without replication. ZooKeeper-based
      multi-master replication will be explained later in this page.

- ``securityEnabled`` (boolean)

  - whether to enable authentication. It's disabled by default so that a user can play with Central Dogma
    without hassle. However, it is strongly encouraged to enable authentication because the authorship of
    a commit is filled in automatically based on the principal of the current user. Central Dogma uses
    `Apache Shiro`_ as its authentication layer and uses the ``conf/security.ini`` file as its security
    configuration. For more information about how to configure `Apache Shiro`_, read
    `this page <https://shiro.apache.org/configuration.html#ini-sections>`_ or check the example configuration
    files under the ``conf/`` directory in the distribution.

- ``mirroringEnabled`` (boolean)

  - whether to enable Git-to-CD mirroring. It's enabled by default. For more information about mirroring,
    refer to :ref:`mirroring`.

- ``numMirroringThreads`` (integer)

  - the number of worker threads dedicated to periodic mirroring tasks. If ``null``, the default value of
    '16 threads' is used.

- ``maxNumFilesPerMirror`` (integer)

  - the maximum allowed number of files in a mirror. If a Git repository contains more files than this,
    Central Dogma will reject to mirror the Git repository. If ``null``, the default value of '8192 files'
    is used.

- ``maxNumBytesPerMirror`` (integer)

  - the maximum allowed number of bytes in a mirror. If the total size of the files in a Git repository exceeds
    this, Central Dogma will reject to mirror the Git repository. If ``null``, the default value of
    '33554432 bytes' (32 MiB) is used.

Configuring replication
-----------------------
Central Dogma features multi-master replication based on `Apache ZooKeeper <https://zookeeper.apache.org/>`_
for high availability. A client can write to any of the available replicas, and thus itâ€™s possible to update
the settings of your application even when all replicas but one are down. The clients will automatically
connect to an available replica.

.. note::

    Don't have a working ZooKeeper cluster yet? Refer to
    `the ZooKeeper administrator's guide <http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.10/zookeeperAdmin.html>`_
    to set up one.

Once you have an access to a ZooKeeper cluster, update the ``replication`` section of ``conf/dogma.json``:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "dataDir": "./data",
      "ports": [
        {
          "localAddress": {
            "host": "*",
            "port": 36462
          },
          "protocol": "http"
        }
      ],
      "numWorkers": null,
      "maxNumConnections": null,
      "requestTimeoutMillis": null,
      "idleTimeoutMillis": null,
      "maxFrameLength": null,
      "numRepositoryWorkers": 16,
      "cacheSpec": "maximumWeight=134217728,expireAfterAccess=5m",
      "webAppEnabled": true,
      "gracefulShutdownTimeout": {
        "quietPeriodMillis": 1000,
        "timeoutMillis": 10000
      },
      "replication" : {
        "method" : "ZOOKEEPER",
        "replicaId": "<replicaId>",
        "connectionString": "zk1.example.com:2181,zk2.example.com:2181,zk3.example.com:2181",
        "pathPrefix": "/service/centraldogma",
        "timeoutMillis": null,
        "numWorkers": null,
        "maxLogCount": null,
        "minLogAgeMillis": null
      },
      "securityEnabled": false
    }

- ``method`` (string)

  - the replication method. ``ZOOKEEPER`` indicates ZooKeeper-based multi-master replication.

- ``replicaId`` (string)

  - the unique and unchanging ID of the replica, e.g. `UUID <https://www.uuidgenerator.net/>`_
  - Be extra cautious so that the replica IDs do not change or duplicate.

- ``connectionString`` (string)

  - the ZooKeeper connection string.

- ``pathPrefix`` (string)

  - the ZooKeeper path prefix. Central Dogma will create entries under this prefix.
  - Be extra cautious so that two different Central Dogma clusters never use the same path prefix
    at the same ZooKeeper cluster.

- ``timeoutMillis`` (integer)

  - the ZooKeeper timeout, in milliseconds. If ``null``, the default value of '1000 milliseconds' (1 second)
    is used.

- ``numWorkers`` (integer)

  - the number of worker threads dedicated for replication. If ``null``, the default value of '16 threads'
    is used.

- ``maxLogCount`` (integer)

  - the maximum number of log items to keep in ZooKeeper. Note that the log entries will still not be removed
    if they are younger than ``minLogAgeMillis``. If ``null``, the default value of '100 log entries' is used.

- ``minLogAgeMillis`` (integer)

  -  the minimum allowed age of log items before they are removed from ZooKeeper. If ``null`` the default
     value of '3600000 milliseconds' (1 hour) is used.
