.. _mirroring:

Better configuration change workflow with Git-to-CD mirroring
=============================================================
Making a configuration change is often a risky business. Pushing an invalid configuration change can cause your
service to malfunction even if zero line of code is changed. To reduce the chance of outage due to incorrect
configuration changes, you would want them reviewed by many eyes before they are applied.

Modern source code hosting services such as `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ and `GitLab <https://about.gitlab.com/>`_
have a notion of `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/>`_. What if we use pull
requests for configuration changes just like we do for source code, given the importance of service
configuration?

With Central Dogma's periodic Git repository mirroring, you can set up the following workflow in your
organization:

- Humans work on a Git repository to manage the configuration files.

  1. Store the configuration files in a Git repository.
  2. Send a pull request that updates the configuration files.
  3. The pull request is reviewed and merged.

- Applications work on a Central Dogma repository to retrieve the configuration files.

  1. Central Dogma mirrors the configuration files in the Git repository into a Central Dogma repository.
  2. Applications watches the configuration files in the Central Dogma repository.

Note that the applications do not access Git repositories directly. There are a few good reasons to make your
applications access Central Dogma repositories instead:

- Source code repositories are often hosted in a different network.
- Source code repositories are not always highly-available, although they may be backed up regularly.
- Central Dogma repositories are highly-available, queryable and watchable.

Setting up a Git-to-CD mirror
-----------------------------
You need to put two files into the ``meta`` repository of your Central Dogma project: ``/mirrors.json`` and
``/credentials.json``.

``/mirrors.json`` contains an array of periodic mirroring tasks. For example:

.. code-block:: json

    [
      {
        "type": "single",
        "enabled": true,
        "schedule": "0 * * * * ?",
        "direction": "REMOTE_TO_LOCAL",
        "localRepo": "foo",
        "localPath": "/",
        "remoteUri": "git+ssh://git.example.com/foo.git/settings#release"
      }
    ]

- ``type`` (string)

  - the type of the mirroring task. Use ``single``.

- ``enabled`` (boolean)

  - whether the mirroring task is enabled. Enabled by default if unspecified.

- ``schedule`` (string)

  - a `Quartz cron expression <http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.x/tutorials/crontrigger.html>`_
    that describes when the mirroring task is supposed to be triggered. If unspecified, ``0 * * * * ?``
    (every minute) is used.

- ``direction`` (string)

  - the direction of mirror. Use ``REMOTE_TO_LOCAL``.

- ``localRepo`` (string)

  - the Central Dogma repository name. The content under the location specified in ``remoteUri`` will be
    mirrored into this repository.

- ``localPath`` (string)

  - the directory path in ``localRepo``. The content under the location specified in ``remoteUri`` will be
    mirrored into this directory in ``localRepo``. If unspecified, ``/`` is used.

- ``remoteUri`` (string)

  - the URI of the Git repository which will be mirrored from.
  - Supported schemes are:

    - ``git+http``
    - ``git+https``
    - ``git+ssh``

  - Path is split after ``.git``. The part after ``.git`` refers the directory inside the Git repository.
    e.g. ``/foo.git/src/settings`` refers to the files under the directory ``/src/settings`` which resides in
    the Git repository ``/foo.git`` If you want to mirror the whole content of the repository, you can simply
    end the URI with ``.git``. e.g. ``git+ssh://git.example.com/foo.git``
  - Fragment represents a branch name. e.g. ``#release`` will mirror the branch ``release``. If unspecified,
    the branch ``master`` is mirrored.

``/credentials.json`` contains the authentication credentials which are required when accessing the Git
repositories defined in ``/mirrors.json``:

.. code-block:: json

    [
      {
        "type": "none",
        "hostnamePatterns": [
          "^git\.insecure\.com$"
        ]
      },
      {
        "type": "password",
        "hostnamePatterns": [
          "^git\.password-protected\.com$"
        ],
        "username": "alice",
        "password": "secret!"
      },
      {
        "type": "public_key",
        "hostnamePatterns": [
          "^.*\.secure\.com$"
        ],
        "username": "git",
        "publicKey": "ssh-rsa ... user@host",
        "privateKey": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
        "passphrase": null
      }
    ]

- ``type`` (string)

  - the type of authentication mechanism: ``none``, ``password`` or ``public_key``.

- ``hostnamePatterns`` (array of strings)

  - the regular repressions that matches a host name. The credential whose hostname pattern matches first will
    be used when accessing a host.

- ``username`` (string)

  - the user name

- ``password`` (string)

  - the password which is used for password-based authentication.

- ``publicKey`` (string)

  - the OpenSSH public key which is used for SSH public key authentication.

- ``privateKey`` (string)

  - the OpenSSH private key which is used for SSH public key authentication.

- ``passphrase`` (string)

  - the passphrase of ``privateKey`` if the private key is encrypted.
    If unspecified or ``null``, the private key should not be encrypted.

.. note::

    You may want to convert your private key into a JSON string using a ``perl`` command::

        $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa | perl -p -0 -e 's/\r?\n/\\n/g'

If everything was configured correctly, the repository you specified in ``localRepo`` will have a file named
``mirror_state.json`` on a successful run, which contains the commit ID of the Git repository:

.. code-block:: json

    {
      "sourceRevision": "22fb176e4d8096d709d34ffe985c5f3acea83ef2"
    }

Mirror limit settings
---------------------
Central Dogma limits the number of files and the total size of the files in a mirror for its reliability.
As your configuration grows, you may want to bump the limit. See :ref:`setup-configuration` to learn about
the options related with mirroring: ``numMirroringThreads``, ``maxNumFilesPerMirror`` and
``maxNumBytesPerMirror``.
