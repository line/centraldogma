Welcome to Central Dogma
========================

*Central Dogma* is an open-source highly-available version-controlled service configuration repository based on
Git, ZooKeeper and HTTP/2.

With Central Dogma, you can:

- Store your configuration files such as ``.json``, ``.yaml`` and ``.xml`` into a centralized, multi-master
  replicated, version-controlled repository.
- Retrieve your configuration using RESTful API, Java library and command-line client.
- Let your servers get notified immediately when the configuration files are updated and the new settings are
  applied without server restarts.
- Send a pull request for configuration changes and get it reviewed and merged by teammates;
  much less chance of making a bad configuration change!
